I don't fully understand the nodejs way, or how it's supposed to work.
As such, adhering to the everchanging JS standards is a pain.
So, all the ugly stuff is in this file, and this file "just works"
Everything else is abstracted away in the game modules, which are
written in their own consistent standard.
